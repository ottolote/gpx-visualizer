# npm resolution error report

While resolving: gpx-visualizer@0.0.0
Found: three@0.178.0
node_modules/three
  three@"^0.178.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer three@">= 0.157.0 < 0.178.0" from postprocessing@6.37.4
node_modules/postprocessing
  postprocessing@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
